Initial release of OneDay mod 1.0.0.0

Lessons learned.
Need Framework 4.7.2 for mod to work, limitation of Vanilla game

How does it work?

Uses an existing handler that handle the 'Enter' button keypress from the argo screen
This is also used for contracts.
If the contract button exists, pressing the enter key will begin the contract.

If the contract button does not exist whne pressing enter the flow of time will begin and a global flag will be set to true.

Second part of the mod looks for the global flag, if it is set to true the next time the week/day value is updated it stops the flow of time and resets the counter.

Have testing situation where, patch was used (enter was pressed), static event occured (mechlab finished), then the 'play' button was pressed.
This did not result in a 'stale' global flag setting being picked up next time the week/day was updated.

Pausing development pending user feedback (I might add more gold plating later, but this seems like a simple start.)
